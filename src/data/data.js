    question: "Why focus on the nonbinary community?",
    answer:
      "Researchers estimate as many as 12 percent of millennials, who now comprise more than 35 percent of the United States workforce, identify as trans or nonbinary, more than double those from Generation X. We want to ensure this community is included when it comes to tools and tips on job searching. A huge focus for xCollective is to bring more diversity in NFTs and the Web3 space generally, so we are explicit about our intentions to include the nonbinary community.      ",
